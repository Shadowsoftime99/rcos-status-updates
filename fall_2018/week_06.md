## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

Most of this week has been spent trying different combinations of compliation/run commands to get it to work, and it used to but it just... stopped. Apparently a major merge happened over this past week, and that might've broke it?

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

I plan to "bother Frank"(TM) about why the project doesn't run, probably a basic syntax error but it's still deep enough that he would likely know where it's from (and be the one who wrote it).

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

It needs to compile! I regret that I don't know enough about the project to locate the issue myself...

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
