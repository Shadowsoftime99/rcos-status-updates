## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

I spent some time learning NodeJS, but unfortunately missed our Saturday meeting as I was traveling over the weekend. The project skeleton was drawn up at that meeting and pushed to the GitHub, which I have seen.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

Hopefully I can finish learning NodeJS this week and jump onto some outstanding issues (database and authorization setup). 

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

I have a test on Thursday, I guess that's it? Knowing NodeJS is also a limiter; I can't do much more until that's done.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.

My Saturdays are a bit busier than I realized this month... Maybe I'll have to re-evaluate my availability or squeeze these meeting in between other events. Luckily we post meeting notes on the Observatory so I can use those as well.
