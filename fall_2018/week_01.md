## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

We had a meeting as a full project group (LATE) and discussed the outline for the project, as well as our goals over the entire semester. We determined the back-end and front-end languages of choice, as well as established a weekly meeting schedule for the entire group (as we are split between small group sections)

Issues were set up on the project Github: [here!](https://github.com/Apexal/late/issues)

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

I personally will continue on working on learning JavaScript and NodeJS. Hopefully Frank will finish the project skeleton soon and we as a group can begin to fill in the gaps.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

The only obstructions I'm personally facing are my schoolwork: I had a quiz this week that I spent time studying for that could've probably been used (and more fun, too!) learning JS.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
