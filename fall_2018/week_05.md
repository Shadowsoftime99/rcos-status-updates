Oh my god, I was just off the grid this entire week due to schoolwork. I vaguely know the events of the meeting last Saturday, but that's it.

I need to re-familiarize myself with exactly what I need to do now.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing much, I have a bit of runoff homework from last week but I can get through that fast
