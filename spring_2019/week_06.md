## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Continued plugging on small feature/button fixes that pop up; the goal is to make the site look as clean and polished as possible.

## This Week's Plan

> I need to ask Frank if he still wants something changed in a specific way, since another group member did something in the same area recently that made it look better.

## Anything Blocking?

> No
