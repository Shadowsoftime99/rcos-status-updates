## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week, I tackled one particular issue from our GitHub. Initially, the dashboard's calendar was initially scrolled to 6am on page load. For most (sane) people, they don't have anything to see at 6am so this was a waste of space. I added functionality to have the calendar start automatically scrolled to the earliest event (or the start of their "available" time if that's earlier than any events)

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> I'm currently on another minor front-end enhancement: adding something to the admin panel to denote admin accounts. After that I plan to ask another project member (Seth) for details about how he's representing the data in developing the algorithm for automatic assignment-placement.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> I'm still getting myself familiar with the general structure of vue.js and the LATE infrastructure, so I sometimes need Frank to help show me where something is hidden in the code. It's also not documented great...

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
