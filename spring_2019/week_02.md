## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I added a small feature to the admin panel: A little star next to a user's name if they're an Admin. My commit explicitly references the issue.

## This Week's Plan

> I plan to keep poking around the small issues on the Github for now

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing major besides still learning the codebase

## Notes

> I'd like to work on larger, algorithmic things like the auto-scheduler. I know slightly how it's being looked at, have thought about the representation (time blocks as a linear array) internally as well.
