## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I did a bit of work (in Java, just since I'm used to the language) regarding how to represent time blocks and what they're filled by at a primitive level, and started some code to build that.

## This Week's Plan

> Spring Break, woohoo! I'll have time to work with the model more and then start considering the algorithm

## Anything Blocking?

> Nope!

## Notes
