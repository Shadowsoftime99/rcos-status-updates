## Last Week's Accomplishments

> The L in LATE stands for Lazy, and keeping in that spirit I made a template for a .bat file that does all of the requisite commands to start up LATE for local testing! Will probably push that to the Github soon if not today.

## This Week's Plan

> Autoscheduler algorithms, continued.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nope! Though I do have a sneaking feeling that the fact I'm doing the testing in Java will catch up to me eventually...

## Notes

> Batch scripts work differently between OSes, so I can't guarantee anything besides Windows...
