## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I found a few more small things to fix, but was otherwise waiting on a fairly major overhaul of Assignments/Exams that merged them into one Coursework section. I acted as another set of eyes to help with visual design for that. Additionally I've been listening to Frank for small things that need to be cleaned up/cleared up.

## This Week's Plan

> Presentation, probably? And whatever comes up.
