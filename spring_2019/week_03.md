## Last Week's Accomplishments

> A few more extremely minor fixes: allowing the calendar for scheduling assignments to scroll outside of "preferred" worktimes, and a fix to the vertical alignment of elements on the footer.

## This Week's Plan

> I'm going to start drafting up some models for the problem of scheduling work blocks between courses. I can think of this like an AI problem; I'm in Intro to AI so this is fitting.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nope!
